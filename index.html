        <h3>Capitan, New Mexico</h3>
        <p>Capitan is a lovely place where my <bold>family</bold> (parents) reside. I have been there numerous times and enjoy it every single time. There is very <bold>little cell reception</bold> and the only real thing to do in Capitan is relax. Capitan is a small town with a population of about 200 or less. It is actually considered a village. Hidden away in the Capitan mountains, it is a great place to just relax for a bit.</p>
