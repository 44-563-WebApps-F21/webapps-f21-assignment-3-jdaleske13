        <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
        <h3>Capitan, New Mexico</h3>
        <p>Capitan is a lovely place where my <b>family</b> (parents) reside. 
            I have been there numerous times and enjoy it every single time. 
            There is very <b>little cell reception</b> and the only real thing to do in Capitan is relax. 
            Capitan is a small town with a population of about 200 or less. It is actually considered a village.
             Hidden away in the Capitan mountains, it is a great place to just relax for a bit.</p>
