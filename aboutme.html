        <h1>Mechanic Man</h1>
        <p>Mechanic Man is a superhero that got into a car wreck. 
            He misdiagnosed a vehicle that led up to the events of his wreck.
            After waking from a coma and getting back to every day life, he found out he had an uncanny
            ability to tell what is wrong with a vehicle just by looking at it. A seemingly useless
            superpower that he uses every day to help others that are in need.
